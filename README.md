# Coursera Robotics Specialization
### Coursera Robotics Specialization Homework
This is the result of many frustrating hours with ~gasp!~ MATLAB &emdash; a hideous excuse for a programming environment.

These assignments are here to show my work while also attempting an elegent solution.  You will not find others' code in this repository, aside from the scripts included in the exercises.

NOTE: This collection will not be maintained to keep up with changes in coursework or MATLAB.  If you find that things change, or you find a more elegent solution, please create an issue on this project to let others know that one exists.

Finally, no `*.mat` files will be provided.  You will have to generate them yourself if you want to submit for credit.
